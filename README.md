# Vehicle-Builder-
## Description


-the purpose of this project was to add to a already existing program that makes cars
-the motivation was to add on to the code and strengthen my understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- and in working on the project I did learn a lot about project oriented programming such as making constructors for objects and implementing parent objects


## Installation
In order to install the application you should download VScode from https://code.visualstudio.com/download, and node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager, then you can clone the application repository from the GitHub  https://github.com/PabloCast253/Vehicle-Builder-
once you have all that downloaded, open the cloned repository in VS code. In an intergrated terminal that is in pathed to the index.ts file type in the terminal `npm start` and the application should run


## usage
once the program is being ran after `npm start` is typed in the command line is being ran you will be asked if you want to create a new vehicle or if you would chose a already created vehicle. if you decide to create a vehicle inquire will ask you some questions and the program will make a car based off your answers after you chose what vehicle you would like to work with you will be given an few options on what action you would like to take with your chosen vehicle.
